# HFT-live-trading
end-to-end deployment of strategies to binance/dydx crypto exchanges

Supports recording of all tick data on binance, kraken, dydx, coinbase and dumps outputs to csv's.
Also supports deployment of linear regression models based on orderbook/trade tick data (signals are already implemented).
Executes orders on DYDX and BNB - requires a VPN or AWS server in Japan.

I have removed some files that contain info about my trading accounts.
